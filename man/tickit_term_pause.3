.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_term_pause\fP() suspends the operation of the terminal by resetting any modes or other persistent state on it as if shutting down. Any modes set within the object instance are remembered however.
.PP
\fBtickit_term_resume\fP() returns the terminal back to the state it was operating in before \fBtickit_term_pause\fP() was called, allowing the program to continue as normal.
.PP
It is intended these functions be used to create a program-wide suspend feature, where the terminal can be handed back over to the invoking shell while the process backgrounds itself. Typically this is done by the process sending itself a \fBSIGSTOP\fP signal via \fBraise\fP(3). After calling \fBtickit_term_pause\fP(), no other terminal-related functions should be called, nor other IO operations attempted, until after a subsequent \fBtickit_term_resume\fP(3).
