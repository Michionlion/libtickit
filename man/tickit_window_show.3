.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtickit_window_show\fP() makes the given window visible, allowing it to receive events and obscure lower sibling windows. This may cause it to receive \fBTICKIT_EV_EXPOSE\fP events when \fBtickit_window_flush\fP(3) is next called.
.PP
\fBtickit_window_hide\fP() makes the given window non-visible, preventing it from receiving events and making it transparent to lower sibling windows, so their content is now visible. This may cause lower siblings to receive \fBTICKIT_EV_EXPOSE\fP events when \fBtickit_window_flush\fP(3) is next called.
.PP
\fBtickit_window_is_visible\fP() tests whether the given window is visible within its immediate parent. This does not imply that it is actually visible to the terminal, as it may still have a hidden parent.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fBtickit_window_show\fP() and \fBtickit_window_hide\fP() return no value. \fBtickit_window_is_visible\fP() returns a boolean.
