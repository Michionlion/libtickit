  * TICKIT_PEN_UNDER type is now integer, supports single, double, wavy underline
  * Fixed various example/demo-*.c files so they work again
  * Added experimental new ability to provide event loop hooks for other event
    loops
  * Deleted the deprecated tickit_string_* functions that were renamed to
    tickit_utf8_*
  * Renumbered TICKIT_PEN_* constants to start from 1; lists can end with 0
  * Use termios to know what backspace (VERASE) character is, rather than
    relying on terminfo - experience from vim, neovim, etc.. is that this is
    often more reliable
  * tickit_watch_* callbacks now receive an info pointer, to match the calling
    style of other object bindings
